# **Difficulty Level of Each Day FOR ME**

| **Day** | **Difficulty Level (1-10)** | **Notes** |
|-----|-------------------------|-------|
| 1   |           **1**              |   It wasn't that bad. Both could be solved after- 1-2 minutes.    |
| 2   |         **1**                |    Same as the first day.   |
| 3   |         **3**                |     I had difficulties with the do() and dont() but overall it wasn't that hard.  |
| 4   |         **5**                |  I needed some time to fully understand. It was hard because of the 2D Matrix which I haven't learned yet.     |
| 5   |          **4**             |    It wasn't as bad as the code looks.    |
