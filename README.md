# **Difficulty Level of Each Day FOR ME**

| **Day** | **Difficulty Level (1-10)** | **Notes** |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| 1       | **1**                       | It wasn't that bad. Both could be solved after 1-2 minutes. |
| 2       | **1**                       | Same as the first day. |
| 3       | **3**                       | I had difficulties with the do() and dont(), but overall it wasn't that hard. |
| 4       | **5**                       | I needed some time to fully understand. It was hard because of the 2D Matrix which I haven't learned yet. |
| 5       | **4**                       | It wasn't as bad as the code looks. |
| 6       | **7**                       | I didn't understand it that much at first. Also, I looked at the task completely differently for a long time than when I actually figured out what I wanted. |
| 7       | **4**                             | It was simple. I needed to search some things online but it was ok           |
| 8       | **4**                          |   I would call it a bit easy. Doesn't require too much brain capacity.        |
| 9       | **8**                            |  Probably the hardest for me yet. I needed a lot of time understanding MYSELF and the code itself.         |
| 10      | **5**                            |  Wasn't that complicated. I just copy-pasted from one of my older solution         |
| 11      |                             |           |
| 12      |                             |           |
| 13      |                             |           |
| 14      |                             |           |
| 15      |                             |           |
| 16      |                             |           |
| 17      |                             |           |
| 18      |                             |           |
| 19      |                             |           |
| 20      |                             |           |
| 21      |                             |           |
| 22      |                             |           |
| 23      |                             |           |
| 24      |                             |           |
| 25      |                             |           |
